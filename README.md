Reel Life is an Android app that allows users to journal or blog about, share, and organize the existing photos in their photo gallery. The app would be built on an algorithm that pulls a “random” cluster of photos from the user’s photo gallery at an interval and time set by the user. The app then prompts the user to select which photos from the cluster they would like to include in the entry; write a caption, description, or blog post about the photos; add tags to the entry; and store the entry in an Instagram-like feed (“reel”) for personal use with the option to share the entry to their social media accounts.
