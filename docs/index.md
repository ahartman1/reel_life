### Project Overview
The Reel Life app is built on an algorithm that pulls a “random” cluster of photos from the user’s photo gallery at an interval and time set by the user. After creating the cluster of photos, the app then prompts the user to select which photos from the cluster they would like to include in their journal entry; write a caption, description, or blog post about the photos; add tags to the entry; and/or store the entry in an Instagram-like feed (“reel”) for personal use with the option to share the entry to their social media accounts.

### Project Goals
        1. Remove the intimidation factor that comes along with starting a journal from scratch
        2. Train user to become a more active journaler by providing several different cluster creation and notification options
        3. Allow users to add context to photos that may already have been grouped automatically in their photo gallery  
        4. Integrate users' journal entries with their social media accounts to create a level of consistency across local app and external platforms
